# InviteManager Pro

The InviteManager Pro bot is available to our premium subscribers with the $5/month tier or higher.  
  
It offers the same features as the InviteManager \(with premium features\), but is hosted on a different server and is therefore not affected by downtimes of the main bot.  
  
If you have a premium subscription, please contact us for a link to invite the bot.  
  
All your settings \(prefix, bonus invites, channels, messages etc\) will also be available in the pro bot and do not have to be configured again. You can have both the regular and the pro bot in your server, but then only the pro bot will be active.
